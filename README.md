# AWS-Project
My AWS projects.




This project demonstrates a scalable, highly available AWS infrastructure setup using EC2 instances across multiple availability zones with an Application Load Balancer. It follows best practices for deploying web applications that require high availability and fault tolerance, allowing seamless distribution of traffic and resilience against failures in any single availability zone.
